# NYC Apartment Search Project

## Description
Imagine that your apartment lease is nearing its end, and it's time to find a new home in the heart of New York City! To guide us in this quest, we rely on a prudent budget, a preference for a serene neighborhood, and a desire for a touch of greenery. Leveraging the NYC Open Data, including 311 complaints, tree census, and Zillow's historic monthly rent averages, we embark on a data-driven exploration. Let's get started!
